# Grapik Designer

**Grapik Designer** is a *prototype* of a graphic design application built in Python, GTK3 and OpenGL that can helps to solve routine problems faced by graphic designers using automation.

## Background

Why do I create Grapik Designer? My biggest motivation is to hone my skills and interests in things related to computer graphics. What I do believe is *the ability in something is a valuable future asset*. Also I wanna hone my skills in finding and solving routine problems faced by graphic designers using my knowledge in the field of automation. I fully understand that you (are designers) can't be replaced by automation  and you won't. Automation will only be your personal design assistant.

## Ideas of Features

- Connect to a collection of world graphic artworks and free public resources.
- Provides a full set of features for research needs and innovations in graphic design.
- Provides assistance to match user designs with customer goals.
- Provides infrastructure to collaborate with each stakeholder, so there'll be no major design changes for tomorrow.

Hmmm... Wait, isn't this all ridiculous? These are just my abstract ideas. I don't even know how to implement everything when I write all of this. Everything will look impossible until it's done.

## Disclaimer

At present, there is no way for people who want to donate to this project. Just because I don't want it. Maybe this decision will change in the future if I need to hire several full-time developers. You can make another contribution to support this project. I'll be very open to accept any suggestions and criticisms from you, as always.
